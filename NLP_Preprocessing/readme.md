# 1. NLP-Tokenization

Welcome to the NLP-Tokenization repository! This repository showcases the power of tokenization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by providing implementations and examples of tokenization algorithms.

## Overview

Tokenization is a key technique in NLP that breaks down text into smaller units called tokens. This repository demonstrates various tokenization algorithms and their applications in text analysis tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition.

## Contents

- `NLP_Tokenization.ipynb`: This file contains the implementation of the tokenization algorithm.


# 2. Stemming and Lemmatization in NLP
This repository provides an implementation of stemming and lemmatization techniques in natural language processing (NLP). Stemming involves reducing words to their root form by removing suffixes, while lemmatization transforms words to their base or dictionary form.

## Contents
- Introduction to Stemming and Lemmatization
- Implementation of Stemming Algorithms (e.g., Porter Stemmer, Snowball Stemmer)
- Implementation of Lemmatization Algorithms (e.g., WordNet Lemmatizer)
- Example Code and Usage
- `NLP_Stemming_Lemmatization.ipynb` : This file contains the implementation of the tokenization algorithm.

# 3. Stopword Removal in NLP
This repository provides an implementation of stopword removal in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Stopwords are commonly occurring words in a language that are often removed from text data during preprocessing to improve the efficiency and accuracy of NLP algorithms.

## Contents
- Introduction to Stopwords and their significance in NLP
- Implementation of Stopword Removal Techniques
- Example Code and Usage
- `NLP_StopWords.ipynb`: This file contains the implementation of the tokenization algorithm.
