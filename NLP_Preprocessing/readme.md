# NLP-Tokenization

Welcome to the NLP-Tokenization repository! This repository showcases the power of tokenization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by providing implementations and examples of tokenization algorithms.

## Overview

Tokenization is a key technique in NLP that breaks down text into smaller units called tokens. This repository demonstrates various tokenization algorithms and their applications in text analysis tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition.

## Contents

- `NLP_Tokenization.ipynb`: This file contains the implementation of the tokenization algorithm.


Happy tokenizing!
